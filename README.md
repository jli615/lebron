# Team Lebron Del Norte Sports Stats
Quick and easy access to your very own Del Norte basketball, soccer, baseball, and football statistics!

## Usage
Navigate [here](http://lebroncs.cf/) to use the application. Once on website, you will be directed through the navigation bar, that will bring you to all available tabs containing statistics.

You can also run it on your local machine by cloning our project from github.

## Ideation
The overall idea of our project is a Del Norte Sports Statistics page. Any user can come view statistics/highlights/the schedule of their favorite Del Norte athlete.
## Purpose
Our purpose behind this website is that we wanted to create a platform where our Del Norte athletes could be honored for their outstanding athletic performance and achievement. This gives an opportunity for players to also present their statistics, in an easy manner, to their friends and family.

## N@tM + Reflections
| Name | Images | Reflection |  |

| Ryan | [Video]() | What went well?
I think that through the trimester my understanding of java has increased and I’ve been able to grow in my code capabilities. I also liked my work with the frontend in HTML, as I did significant work for the website.
What didn't go that well?
Something that didn’t go too well were the minilabs, as I struggled with them. They took a good amount of time to complete, and I had to seek a lot of help. They did better help my overall understanding of code, and I will only continue to get better.
What did every team member learn?
Justin had learned how to deploy on AWS and had become more familiar with PBL based learning. Rohan K had mastered JAVA and the logic behind them. Rohan N had become more familiar with Java, and had mastered PBL. I have overall become more familiar with java, still am not the most experienced with it, but I am growing. I’ve also mastered PBL and frontend work. All together, we learned to communicate and grew as a team throughout the trimester.
What puzzles every team member?
One thing that still confuses our whole team is formatting issues with thymeleaf. We never grasped a good understanding of the programming language.
What was your favorite mini-lab project?
My favorite mini lab project had to be with the loops. I created algorithms for for, while, and recursion loops. I did an arithmetic sequence, and had been successful with it. It was one of the minilabs that was challenging, but I had overcome the challenge and done well.
What was your favorite CB topic?
My favorite CB topics were loops and recursion, as they were the ones I best understood and were most successful in. They were fun to create and seen run.
Identify in priority order biggest challenges.
-The biggest challenge for us was to connect the java backend to the HTML front end. We always struggled with doing this as we lacked the understanding of both areas.
-The second challenge we faced was getting a good API for our project. We did end up getting one on our website, but it wasn’t what we were looking for; we wanted an API that could relate to our DNHS sports stats website.
What was your favorite N@tM project?
My favorite N@tM had to be one of the skulls I had seen in the ceramics room. It was well designed and painted very well. I had created a similar project like that a couple years back when I took ceramics, so it was fun to see them again. | [Ticket](https://github.com/jli615/lebroncs/issues/48) |

### Project Idea
Our website will be a one-stop sports page that will follow the Del Norte sports teams. We will provide up to data information about the schedules, scores, stats, rosters, and interviews of many Varsity and Junior Varsity sports teams. Our purpose for this website is to provide a spot where Del Norte Student Athletes can come and see all information about their team. 

We will be building this website through Spring and Thymeleaf. We will also be using HTML, CSS, and Java to make our website. The main goal will be to build a database with all the Del Norte sports teams information (stats, schedule, scores, rosters, etc.) Then we will be able to pull data to present in our website!
