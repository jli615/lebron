# Team Lebron Del Norte Sports Stats
Quick and easy access to your very own Del Norte basketball, soccer, baseball, and football statistics!

## Usage
Navigate [here](http://lebroncs.cf/) to use the application. Once on website, you will be directed through the navigation bar, that will bring you to all available tabs containing statistics.

You can also run it on your local machine by cloning our project from github.

## Ideation
The overall idea of our project is a Del Norte Sports Statistics page. Any user can come view statistics/highlights/the schedule of their favorite Del Norte athlete.
## Purpose
Our purpose behind this website is that we wanted to create a platform where our Del Norte athletes could be honored for their outstanding athletic performance and achievement. This gives an opportunity for players to also present their statistics, in an easy manner, to their friends and family.

### Project Idea
Our website will be a one-stop sports page that will follow the Del Norte sports teams. We will provide up to data information about the schedules, scores, stats, rosters, and interviews of many Varsity and Junior Varsity sports teams. Our purpose for this website is to provide a spot where Del Norte Student Athletes can come and see all information about their team. 

We will be building this website through Spring and Thymeleaf. We will also be using HTML, CSS, and Java to make our website. The main goal will be to build a database with all the Del Norte sports teams information (stats, schedule, scores, rosters, etc.) Then we will be able to pull data to present in our website!
